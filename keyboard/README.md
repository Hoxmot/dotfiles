# Keyboard layouts

## HoxLander

The current configuration of my keyboard layouts.

It's mostly focused on programing, but also has a League of Legneds layer to help me play with a little bit different layout than I'm used to.

Since I use the keyboard on both Windows and MacOS, the layout requires a little bit of configuration on MacOS. I think on most keyboards,
and certainly on this keyboard, `Win` key from Windows and `Cmd` key from MacOS are the same. It's not comfortable, since you use `Cmd` more often
than `Win`. Because of that, I suggest replacing `Cmd` and `Ctrl` in the keyboard settings on MacOS. This way, `Cmd` is under `Z` and `/` code,
while `Ctrl` is under `X` and `.`. At the same time, on Windows `Ctrl` is under `Z` and `/`, while `Win` is under `X` and `.`.
